# Mathematical Structures in the Mizar Math Library

Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) contains a large collection of Mizar-verified
proofs published over the last 30 years. While trying to understand the
structure of all these proofs, Iâ€™ve been writing some tools to build Graphviz
concept maps.

Here is one such map, a hierarchical relationship diagram of just the
mathematical structures.

I plan on generating more diagrams for the types, functions, modes, etc.
