In[108]:= ?Assert
Assert[test] represents the assertion that test is True. If assertions have been enabled, test is evaluated when the assertion is encountered. If test is not True, then an assertion failure is generated.
Assert[test,tag] specifies a tag that will be used to identify the assertion if it fails. >>
